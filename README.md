Earthquake Data to KML Converter

I developed a Python-based tool that automates the conversion of real-time earthquake data into KML format for geographical visualization.
This project fetches live earthquake data from the USGS API, processes it using Pandas, and generates a KML file that displays earthquake locations, magnitudes,
and timestamps in a user-friendly map format. The tool enables easy integration with geographic information systems (GIS) for enhanced spatial analysis and visualization.

Key technologies: Python, Pandas, KML, USGS Earthquake Data API
